# volume_for_term

sets system volume to specified percentage

## Usage
volume [0-100]

## Dev Notes
Just a fun experiment with osascript (on macos) and a smidge of terminal UI in bash.

Basically this is a toy for learning purposes.  Not much actual utility -- or, at least, volume can be adjusted more quickly/directly by using dedicated hotkeys on keyboad.
